# Titanic-survival-prediction
Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic based on key features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more. The project uses the Titanic dataset, a popular dataset for machine learning practice, to build and evaluate a predictive model.

Features
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Processed and transformed features, including encoding categorical variables and creating new meaningful features.
Model Implementation: Trained a logistic regression model to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for data processing and model building.
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
scikit-learn: For model training and evaluation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing data insights and model results.

Results
The logistic regression model demonstrated good performance in predicting survival, providing insights into key factors like passenger class and gender that significantly influenced survival rates.

Future Enhancements
Explore additional machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Visualize more detailed feature correlations.
